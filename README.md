# yelp-review-classifier

I trained a classifier using a Yelp dataset of reviews to categorize the reviews by their sentiment (i.e. bad, neutral, good). I created this in order to better understand the process of using machine learning algorithms to learn from data as well as research and apply NLP techniques to understand text.
